The most complete iteration of this lib exists in blackbox/c-sharp-from-unity-project/soundengine.cs. This is all in a single file because it was being repeatedly imported into an in-development unity game. It's a reactive piece of procedurally-generated music that was created specifically for this game, but sadly, the game was never released. The file soundengine.cs contains a bunch of code for generating audio and musical structures.

An audio example can be found here: http://ericfairbanks.org/csharp_audio_engine_demo.mp3

Everything you hear there apart from the percussion samples is generated on-the-fly.
